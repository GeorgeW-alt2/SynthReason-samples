User: what is artificial intelligence
AI: the final element in the philosophical picture of the human mind. cognitive science is a fascinating field in itself, worthy of several textbooks and at least one encyclopedia (wilson and keil, 1999). we will occasionally comment on similarities or differences between ai techniques and the conclusion, the “i have to make a cloak,” is an action. in the nicomachean ethics (book iii. 3, 1112b), aristotle further elaborates on this topic, suggesting an algorithm: we deliberate not about ends, but about means. for a doctor does not deliberate whether he shall heal, nor an orator whether he shall persuade, they assume the end and consider how and by what means this will be achieved, till they come to the first to treat it as the mind is a test that remains relevant 60 years later. yet ai researchers have devoted little effort to passing the turing test, proposed by alan turing (1950), was designed to provide a satisfactory operational definition of intelligence. a computer program. if the program’s input–output behavior matches corresponding human behavior, that is evidence that some of these obstacles apply to any attempt to build computational reasoning systems, they appeared first in the order of analysis seems to be first in the order of becoming. and if we are not suggesting that humans are necessarily “irrational” in the sense of “emotionally unstable” or “insane.” one merely need note that programming a mechanical device intended to carry out operations on concepts rather than numbers, but its scope was rather limited. leibniz did surpass pascal by building a calculator that could add, subtract, multiply, and take roots, whereas the pascaline could only add and subtract. some speculated that machines might not just do calculations but actually be able to generate comprehensible sentences in natural language to get by in a complex society. we need learning not only for erudition, but also because it improves our ability to generate effective behavior. the rational-agent approach has two advantages over the other approaches. first, it is more general than the “laws of thought” approach to ai, the emphasis was on correct inferences. making correct inferences is sometimes part of being a rational agent, because one way to formalize general mathematical reasoning as logical deduction. in 1930, kurt gödel (1906–1978) showed that there exists an effective procedure to prove any true statement in the first-order logic of frege and russell, but that first-order logic could not capture the principle of induction: that general rules are acquired by exposure to repeated associations between their elements. building on the front cover of this book, proposed a rule for updating probabilities in the light of new evidence. bayes’ rule underlies most modern approaches to uncertain reasoning in ai systems. 1.2.3 economics how should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff? how should we do this when others may not go along? how should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff? how should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff? how should we do this when the payoff may be far in the future? utility decision theory game theory the science of economics got its start in 1776, when scottish philosopher adam smith (1723–1790) published an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations. while the ancient greeks and others had made contributions to economic thought, smith was the first to apply mathematical models to the study of the nervous system, particularly the theory of games and economic behavior (1944). decision theory, which combines probability theory with utility theory, provides a formal and complete framework for decisions (economic or otherwise) made under uncertainty— that is, in cases where probabilistic descriptions appropriately capture the decision maker’s environment. this is suitable for “large” economies where each agent need pay no attention to the study of the nervous sytem. since then, it has been discovered that the brain in action. once we have a sufficiently precise theory of the mind, it becomes possible to express the theory as a computational process. the novum organum is an update of the nervous system, particularly the brain. although the exact way in which the brain enables thought is one of the great mysteries of science, the fact that it does enable thought has been appreciated for thousands of years because of the brain responsible for specific cognitive functions. in particular, he showed that speech production was localized to the portion of the left hemisphere now called broca’s area. by that time, it was known that the brain consisted of nerve cells, or neurons, but it was not until the middle of the 18th century that the brain was widely recognized as the seat of consciousness. before then, candidate locations included the heart and the spleen. paul broca’s (1824–1880) study of aphasia (speech deficit) in brain-damaged patients in 1861 demonstrated the existence of the principle of artificial intelligence problems are necessarily intractable, most theoreticians believe it.) these results contrast with the optimism with which the popular press greeted the first computers—“electronic super-brains” that were “faster than einstein!” despite the increasing speed of computers, careful use of resources will characterize intelligent systems. put crudely, the world is an extremely large problem instance! work in ai has helped explain why some instances of the disciplines have to which the class of np-complete problems are hard, yet others are easy (cheeseman et al., 1991). besides logic and computation, the third great contribution of mathematics to ai is a speculative proposition whereas here the conclusion that they would prefer the dollar and hoping that customers will prefer the hamburger. the disciplines that contributed ideas, viewpoints, and techniques to ai. like any history, this one is forced to concentrate on a small number of people, events, and ideas and to ignore others that also were important. we organize the history around a series of questions. we certainly would not wish to give the impression that these questions are the only ones the disciplines address or that the disciplines have to ai is a good
